If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.1 And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

PoliSciPy is great for:

- Creating customized, high-quality electoral college maps of the United States
- Conducting political data analysis and tracking changes in voting history and patterns

Other than that, youâ€™re free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

    <img src="assets/election_2024.png" alt="Electoral College Map" width="974">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><em>Example: Figure with results from the 2024 U.S. election.</em></div>
